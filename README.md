# DILI_Bayesian_Model
This repository contains example code for Bayesian Neural Networks (BNN) and other ML approaches utilizing publicly available AstraZeneca's in-vitro assay data. 

## Objectives :crossed_fingers:
AZ's Bayesian hepatic safety model was recapitulated and then the model was improved adding a few important descriptors along with the in vitro assay data.

## Requirements :crossed_fingers:
> [!TIP]
> Start working with Google Colab or Jupyter Notebook! 
> * First, install the following packages using pip3 or pip:
`chembl_webresource_client`
`pandas`
`rdkit`
`numpy`
`matplotlib`
`seaborn`
`scipy`
`scikit-learn`
`lazypredict`
`keras`
`tensorflow`
> * Get PaDEL-Descriptor file: wget https://github.com/dataprofessor/bioinformatics/raw/master/padel.zip to compute Descriptors
